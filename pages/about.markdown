<h1>About JA by Redlii</h1>

<h2>What is Redlii</h2>
<p>Redlii is an idea about liberation, accepting change, helping others, and understanding our own self.</p>

<p>Both Redlii and Redlli are acceptable. It's not about how you spell it or read it, it's about how you see it.</p>

<h2>What is JA?</h2>
<p>JA is very small at the moment, but we wish to be one of the leading organizations developing open-source apps that will make life easier and fun games that are not goal-oriented but for people to enjoy. With this small mission, JA was formed.</p>
